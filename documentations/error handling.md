# Error Handling Strategy with ErrorHandler Middleware

## Core Strategy

The core of the error handling strategy is the ErrorHandler middleware. This middleware is designed to catch any errors that occur during request processing and to format a user-friendly response based on the nature of the error encountered.

## Implementation Details

```javascript
const ErrorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error("Middleware Error Handling:", err);
  const errStatus = err.statusCode || 500;
  const errMsg = err.message || 'Something went wrong on the server.';
  
  if (errMsg.includes("Cannot read properties of null")) {
    res.status(errStatus).redirect(`/error-page?error=${encodeURIComponent('Transcript not found')}`);
  } else if (errMsg.includes("Cast to ObjectId failed for value")) {
    res.status(errStatus).redirect(`/error-page?error=${encodeURIComponent('Transcript not found, invalid Id')}`);
  } else {
    res.status(errStatus).redirect(`/error-page?error=${encodeURIComponent(errMsg)}`);
  }
};
```

## Features

- **Centralized Error Logging**: All errors caught by this middleware are logged to the console with a prefix "Middleware Error Handling:" to facilitate debugging and monitoring.
- **Status Code Management**: The middleware determines the appropriate HTTP status code based on the error object (`err.statusCode`) or defaults to 500 if not specified.
- **Error Message Customization**: It customizes the error message based on the error's nature, ensuring that the feedback provided to the end-user is relevant and helpful.
- **Specific Error Handling**: The middleware includes specific checks for common error scenarios, such as null object references or issues with MongoDB's ObjectId, and redirects users to an error page with a descriptive message.
- **Fallback Error Handling**: For errors that do not match specific checks, the middleware redirects users to a generic error page with the error message.

## Application-Wide Error Handling

The ErrorHandler middleware is used application-wide and is the last middleware to be executed in the request-handling chain, ensuring that any unhandled errors are caught and processed.

## Error Propagation

Errors from various operations (e.g., database operations, file handling) are propagated to the ErrorHandler middleware using the `next` function. This approach simplifies error handling in individual routes and operations, as demonstrated in the provided code snippets for operations like adding, fetching, updating, and deleting audio data.

## Not Found Handler

A special case of error handling is the catch-all route for handling requests to undefined routes. It creates an Error object with a 404 status code and a message indicating that the requested resource was not found. This error is then passed to the ErrorHandler middleware for consistent processing.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const err = new Error('Not Found');
  err.statusCode = 404;
  err.message = 'The requested resource was not found on this server.';
  next(err);
});
```
