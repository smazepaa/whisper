It ensures our app is optimized for **both small and large files**, ensuring a quick **multilingual transcription** process with **minimal errors**.


## Technology Stack
The application is built with a combination of modern technologies that ensure reliability and performance:

- **Backend**: 2 main servers with websokets for interserver communication - Node.js as the main server, Django as the transcription engine. Additionally Redis server for caching.
- **Frontend**: Robust frontend technologies for a dynamic user experience (Pug, JavaScript, CSS).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisities
- Python 3.12 (for latest Django version)
- Django 5.0.2
- Redis server
  
#
### Installation

Before installing, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) installed on your system.

### Clone the repo

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/smazepaa/whisper.git
cd whisper
```

### Install dependencies
#### Node.js

First enter the folder with the Node.js project
```
cd expressServer
```

Install the required dependencies using
```
npm install
```
- `axios`: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- `body-parser`: Node.js body parsing middleware.
- `cors`: Middleware to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- `express`: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- `form-data`: A module to create readable "multipart/form-data" streams.
- `http-errors`: Create HTTP error objects.
- `method-override`: Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesn't support it.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- `morgan`: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
- `multer`: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files.
- `pug`: High-performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers.
- `redis`: A robust, performance-focused, and full-featured Redis client for Node.js.
- `ws`: A simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and server implementation.

#### Django

Go to the Django project
```
cd djangoServer
```
Install the dependencies with 
```
pip install
```
- `channels`: It allows Django to asynchronously support WebSocket requests in a way that's similar to traditional HTTP requests.
- `daphne`: A part of the Django Channels project. It is particularly suited to handling long-lived WebSocket connections.
- `axios`: A promise-based HTTP client that allows you to make requests to HTTP endpoints, perfect for RESTful API interactions.
- `openai-whisper`: The interface to the Whisper API provided by OpenAI for audio processing and transcription.
- `pydub`: A Python library for audio manipulation and editing. 
- `websockets`: A Python library for building WebSocket servers and clients.

#
### Start the application
**Start Express server** (running on port 3001)
```
node app.js
```

**Start Django server** (running on port 8000)
```
python manage.py runserver
```
_These servers can also be started using IDEs (e.g. WebStorm for Express, PyCharm for Django)_

**Start Redis server** (running on default port 6379)
```
wsl -d Ubuntu
sudo service redis-server start
redis-cli
```
